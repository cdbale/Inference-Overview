## Review of the Inference Workflow

Scenario: Opening a Successful Soda Shop

Imagine you are an entrepreneur who wants to open a successful soda shop and need to determine what factors drive daily soda sales (Y). Let's go through an example of using the inferential modeling framework.

## Consider the data-generating process.

$Y$ (Target Variable): Daily soda sales.

$X_p$ (Predictor Variables): Factors that may influence sales:

- Price of soda ($X_1$)
- Store location (urban vs. suburban) ($X_2$)
- Time of day (morning vs. afternoon vs. evening) ($X_3$)
- Weather conditions (temperature, rain, etc.) ($X_4$)
- Marketing efforts (social media ads, loyalty programs, discounts) ($X_5$)
- Competitor presence nearby ($X_6$)

**Key Question**: Can I collect data on these variables? If yes, how? (Point-of-sale data, surveys, web traffic, weather reports, etc.)

## Build a Model for Soda Sales ($Y$)

Since daily soda sales are a continuous variable, we choose a linear regression model:

$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1SodaPrice_i + ... + \beta_6CompetitorPresence_i + \epsilon_i$

If we were modeling whether a given day was a "top-selling" day or not, we would use a logistic regression model.

## Simulate Data Based on Realistic Parameter Values

Assume plausible values for each coefficient:

- A higher price ($X_1$) leads to lower sales (negative coefficient).
- Being in an urban area ($X_2$) leads to higher sales.
- Morning sales ($X_3$) are higher than evening sales.
- Bad weather ($X_4$) may decrease sales.
- Marketing promotions ($X_5$) increase sales.
- Competitor presence ($X_6$) decreases sales.

Generate simulated data and make sure the model estimates match expectations. DO THE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OVERLAP WITH THE COEFFICIENT VALUES WE CHOSE? --> **recovery**.

## Exploratory Analysis and Data Wrangling

OBTAIN YOUR REAL DATA!

- Ensure the data set is in a tidy format (each row = one day, each column = one variable).
- Handle missing values (e.g., missing weather data).
- Remove incorrect values (e.g., a negative sales amount).
- Create visualizations, compute summary statistics of interest, etc. Can you uncover preliminary evidence that suggests that your $X$ variables affect $Y$?

GET TO KNOW YOUR DATA.

## Split the Data Into Training and Testing Sets

Why?

## Exam Prep Analogy

Imagine you're preparing for a big exam. You have a textbook full of practice problems and want to ensure youâ€™re truly ready for the test. Here's how you approach it:

You start by working through practice problems in your textbook. You check your answers, learn from mistakes, and improve your problem-solving skills.

You re-solve the practice problems and your score improves dramatically. You feel excited and ready to take the exam!

## Test Day Woes...

You take the exam in the testing center, and you get a 50%! **F**!

What happened?

## Exam Prep Analogy

- If you (the model) memorize patterns of the training data, it will result in poor performance on the testing data!
  
- Your goal should be to *learn the underlying principles and techniques* so you can apply them to a new set of problems!

- The same thing goes for statistical models - we want them to learn the underlying relationships from the data generating process, NOT memorize patterns in the training data!
  
## Wait...Once I take the Exam isn't that too Late?

We "create" test data by reserving some of our training data. (You can reserve a subset of practice problems for a "final evaluation" prior to the exam.)
  
**We evaluate models on test data to ensure that we are getting the model that is most likely to perform well on unseen data**.

## Back to the Inference Workflow...

## Pre-process the Training Data

- Transform variables if needed (e.g., log-transform sales, price if necessary).
- Convert categorical variables (e.g., location, time of day) into dummy variables.

You can *sort of* think of this as defining the type of questions that will be on the exam...*e.g.*, are we giving the model multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, open response, or a mix of these. You are defining the format of the exam.

## Fit the Model to the Training Data

Estimate the coefficients $\beta_0, ..., \beta_p$.

## Evaluate Parameter Estimates

Check if the coefficients are statistically significant.

See if the estimates match expectations!

- Is the price coefficient negative?
- Does marketing positively impact sales?

## Note on Inferential Modeling

We *never* drop variables from our model just because they aren't statistically significant.

We let our theories about the data-generating process drive decisions about what variables are included.

Example: I regress sales on price and price is not statistically significant.

- statistically insignificant variables may be correlated with one of our other X's and our Y --> omitted variable bias.
- just because it's not statistically significant, doesn't mean it's not part of the data generating process. Our data/model just can't provide evidence that it *is*.

However...we can use the quality of test data predictions as a deciding factor if variable inclusion is in question.

## Pre-Process the Test Data

This pre-processing should be *exactly* the same as it was for the training data.

Why? Would you expect to perform well on an exam with open-ended questions when you practiced on multiple choice responses?

## Evaluate Predictive Accuracy on the Test Data

- Use RMSE to evaluate model performance. This would be accuracy if we were using a logistic regression.
- What if we only have one model? Use the average of $Y$ as your **baseline** prediction. Does your model improve accuracy over that baseline?

## Generate Counterfactual Scenarios

Evaluate potential decisions.

- What happens if we reduce the price by 10%?
- What if we run a marketing campaign on social media?
- What if we made these efforts when the weather was sunny vs. rainy?

## Make Managerial Recommendations

- If price elasticity is high, consider pricing strategies carefully.
- If weather significantly impacts sales, adjust accordingly
  - alter store hours
  - offer delivery or other promotions on rainy days
- If marketing has a strong impact, increase your spend on high-return platforms or channels

## That's It!

Go start those projects!
